I am the first person in my fatherâ€™s family side that has attended college, wants to pursue graduate studies or talks about future career paths. My other younger or older cousins either have no interest in pursuing a college degree or are not capable of doing so because of economic and accessibility problems. They live their lives from day to day and have not even considered what they want or might do in the future. Both the lack of interest and the other problems have to do with the fact that our family has had limited access to certain opportunities (economic, academic, etc.) over time. Nevertheless, I understand there are practical and effective ways to widen the scope of opportunities for people to get to college or achieve their dreams whatever they may be. There are ways to create opportunities for those who cannot acquire them in traditional ways. We can make paths to reinvent our futures trough innovation. I want to work in public service because I believe in our capabilities as human beings and because I want widen the scope of opportunities for everyone and anyone capable of a dream. We are capable of doing so much more than societies expects from us. We are capable of building our own futures as we see fit either as individuals, communities or societies and should not be denied of our possibilities because we were born in a specific place and time. </p>
