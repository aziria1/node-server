            <p>This website was created for the Imagine Santurce Initiative. It was built using Wordpress and Buddypress to ensure easy customization from anyone in the initiative.We are currently working on integrating and training the whole network of participants in the possible uses for the page. I'm also developing alongside communities a visitor segment on the page that will allow people from outside of Puerto Rico to visit and stay at the home's of project leaders while they help with the project. </p>
